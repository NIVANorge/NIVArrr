## Welcome to NIVArrr!

This page gathers together useful links and tutorials to help NIVA staff perform data analysis using the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/about.html). Whether you're an experienced R user or just getting to grips with programming for the first time, we hope you'll find something here to help/interest you.

### 1. Getting started with R

 1.1. **Beginner's guides**  
* [What is R?](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) - The R-Project home page. Probably not the best place to start, but the *official* place to start  
* [R for cats · and cat lovers](https://rforcats.net/) - A classic, unintimidating guide   
* [ComputerWorld's R guide (pdf)](../pdf/r4beginners_v3.pdf) - 40-page illustrated pdf, quite nice  
* [RYouWithMe](https://rladiessydney.org/courses/ryouwithme/) - Nice, tidyverse-centric (ggplot2 and the like)  
* [Introduction to R (Univ. of Melbourne)](https://r-unimelb.gitbook.io/rbook/) - Again, both Australian and tidyverse-centric   

 1.2. **[Installing R and R-Studio at NIVA](https://github.com/NIVANorge/NIVArrr/blob/master/pdf/raoul_w_faglunsj_r.pdf)**. Raoul's Faglunsj guide to installing R and R studio locally on a NIVA computer  
 
 1.3. **[Using NIVA's Data Science Toolkit](https://jupyterhub.niva.no)**. (*Only accessible to members of the NIVA-Norge GitHub organisation*). A cloud-based platform for data science built around JupyterLab, Python, R and Julia
 
 1.4 **Problem solving**   
* [RSeek](https://rseek.org/) - Google tailored for R searches. Searches in StackOverflow, R packages etc. Brilliant.    
* [Stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r) - Include `[r]` when you search, in order to avoid answers about Python, Javascript etc.  
* [CRAN packages](https://cran.r-project.org/) - select "Packages" in the left margin. Search using Ctrl+F   
* [Dag's Googledocs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/146IAr0Z6b19w4mRjtvTd-9_3hvY5n-bNIn4v5T3aw2E/edit) - If I google something and I find an answer, I usually note it down here. And I google *a lot*.
